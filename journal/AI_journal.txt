Week 1

This week I used AI to help me explain the .find() method for
this weeks exercises. I just needed a general idea of how it worked so I could better
understand it. I didn't use it to complete any exercises, I just needed
that general understanding of how .find() operates. 

Week 2
This week I used AI to explain to me what enumerate meant in Python

Week 3
This week I used AI to help explain what exercise 29 was asking for on the homework.
At first I was confused on what the exercise was asking me to do, but AI
helped make it much clearer for me and I understood it.
