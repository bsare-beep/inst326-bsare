that general understanding of how .find() operates.

Week 4
This week I used AI to help explain Excercise 16 on the homework. I was confused on the basic idea
but it helped me better understand what was going on. Once it explained the context behind
the available and total copies I was able to figure out how to tackle the assignment.
