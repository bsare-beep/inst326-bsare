Week 1

This week I used AI to help me explain the .find() method for
this weeks exercises. I just needed a general idea of how it worked so I could better
understand it. I didn't use it to complete any exercises, I just needed
that general understanding of how .find() operates. 

Week 2
This week I used AI to explain to me what enumerate meant in Python

Week 3
This week I used AI to help explain what exercise 29 was asking for on the homework.
At first I was confused on what the exercise was asking me to do, but AI
helped make it much clearer for me and I understood it.

Week 4
This week I used AI to help explain Excercise 16 on the homework. I was confused on the basic idea
but it helped me better understand what was going on. Once it explained the context behind
the available and total copies I was able to figure out how to tackle the assignment.

This week I used AI to help me get a general idea of my project. I wasn't really sure how to approach it,
so I just asked the AI for a striaght to the point kind of approach to start giving me ideas.
